            <p>Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and 
            arranged in program decks. 
            In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[5] 
            Later a control panel (plugboard) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed 
            for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, 
            were programmed by control panels in a similar way; as were the first electronic computers. However, 
            with the concept of the stored-program computers introduced in 1949, both programs and data were 
            stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory. 
            Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular 
            machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer 
            specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation 
            code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little 
            more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction 
            sets also have different assembly languages.

            Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. See computer programming
            in the punch card era. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became 
            inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text 
            editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than 
            with punched cards.


        </p><b>Езиците от високо ниво</b> позволяват на програмиста да пише по-абстрактни и по-малко обвързани
        с хардуера програми. Те позволяват на програмистите да посочват изчисления, въвеждайки формула директно
        (пр., Y = X^2 + 5*X + 9). <b>FORTRAN</b>, първият широко разпространен език от високо ниво излиза през
        1957 г. и много други езици последват: <b>COBOL</b>, който е ориентиран към обработване на комерсиални данни,
        и <b>Lisp</b> - за изследователски цели.
